#summary Description of the game environment.

= Summary =
The test game takes the shape of a classic turn-based strategy game with a top-down view.

[http://interactive-stories.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/wiki/screen01.png]
== World View ==
On the right side of the above screen capture we can see a portion of the terrain on which the game is played. Here is a list of the different shapes and colors with their corresponding semantics:
  * Blue cross: A group of people that is part of your clan.
  * Red cross: A group of people that is not part of your clan.
  * Golden cell: A unit of terrain that can be mined of gold.
  * Orange wireframe rectangle: Your selector.
  * Darkened cells: Terrain that lies outside of your visibility radius.

Note that it is only possible to see enemy groups and golden cells if they are within the visibility radius of one (or more) of your groups.

== Menu Panel ==
On the left side of the screen capture we can see the game menu. It is composed of three main panels and some additional information.
=== Global Panel ===
This panel indicates the total number of remaining clans and the total population.
=== Clan Panel ===
This panel indicates the clan population, the number of groups, the gold owned by the clan, and the clan attributes:
  * Stamina is the amount of actions your groups will dispose of at the beginning of a turn.
  * Attack is the capacity of your groups to reduce enemy groups' population when attacking them.
  * Defense is the capacity of your groups to protect from enemy groups' attacks.
  * Culture defines how much other clans will tend to have a natural positive bias towards your clan.
=== Groups Panel ===
This panel indicates how many groups are currently selected and the total selected population.
The *_<Select Subgroup>_* button allows you to create a subgroup from a selected group as explained in the Actions section.
