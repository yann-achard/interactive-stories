The aim of this project is to prove the validity of a mathematical model of conflict that enhances Richardsonâ€™s model of Arms Race accounting for interactive scenarios, such as the ones provided by CRPGs (Computer Role Playing Games) and strategy games. Such an improvement translates the model into a fuzzy extension of an HCP (Hybrid Control Process).
